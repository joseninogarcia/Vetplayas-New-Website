##VetPlayas New Website

###About the Project

VetPlayas website is one of my project last 2013 about veterinary. The site has an existing template about the pet care but I was about to change as well the template from scratch. I uploaded here the front-end using HTML5 and CSS3. I didn't used any framework about mobile responsive but sooner or later.
