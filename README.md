##VetPlayas New Website

###About the Project

VetPlayas website is one of my project last 2013 about veterinary. The site has an existing template about the pet care but I was about to change as well the template from scratch with the help of some colleagues who has the ability to build site. I uploaded here the front-end using HTML5 and CSS3. I didn't used any framework about mobile responsive because this applicable only for web browsers.
